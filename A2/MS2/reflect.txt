Assignment: 2
Milestone:  2

From this assignment, I learned how to divide a problem into smaller parts. Although the
strategy of decomposition can be applied to other parts of programming, this milestone
was specifically about extracting user-input related features into helper functions.
Writing CLI is a very delicate matter in C programming because it requires accurate
handling of the standard input and char pointers. As demonstrated in assignment 1, single
misplaced character can result in noticeably inconvenient user experience. This is why it
is a good idea to abstract away user-input related features.

In C programming language, a reusable piece of algorithm can be expressed as a function.
Also, C allows separating the shape (prototype) of a function from the implementation. If
there were no functions, software development would get more complicated, as no software
can be divided into smaller parts. Absence of functions will also be detrimental to
collaboration workflow. In this assignment, [contactHelpers] module was separated from
[contacts] module because [contactHelpers] module is explicitly about user-input and
independent from [struct Contact].

Personally, I found the test code (a2ms2.c) provided by the instructor helpful while I
was implementing each helper functions. I could test each function independently, and
quickly narrow down issues as they occur.
